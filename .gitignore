# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
rails/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
rails/db/*.sqlite3
rails/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
rails/log/*.log
rails/tmp

*.rbc
capybara-*.html
.rspec

# TODO Comment out these rules if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo

## Environment normalisation:
rails/.bundle
rails/vendor/bundle

# these should all be checked in to normalise the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# if using bower-rails ignore default bower_components path bower.json files
